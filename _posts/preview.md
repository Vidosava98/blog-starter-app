This blog is mostly about my experience working on this project. It's not my first application,and it's definitely not the first one I’ve built while exploring new technologies. Over time, I’ve realized that the best way to learn isn’t by just reading theory or memorizing best practices — it's by building something. Try, fail, learn, and improve. That’s how you become a real developer: by learning from your mistakes. This time was no different.

I started with some legacy code — actually, it was my first portfolio, which I had built a few months ago
using JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

What I discovered is that sometimes, it’s not more time that you need — it’s inspiration.

# My First Real React Project

This was my first serious application built with React. I’d been learning React mostly on my own — using great online resources, following advice from my mentor — and I felt like I was moving in the right direction. Still, I had doubts. I had never used a frontend framework before, so my concerns were real. I wasn’t sure how React would fit into my application — how components work, how to organize them, and what “best practices” even meant in real projects.

## So... Components?

Whenever I talk to someone about React, the first thing that comes up is usually components — when to use them, why we use them, and how many we really need.

At first, I kept asking myself:

- Do I really need to split this into multiple components?
- Will this component actually be reusable or is it just adding complexity?
- Where does this component belong in my project structure?
- And most importantly — will I reuse this later, or am I overengineering?

These are important questions, especially when you find yourself looking at a 200-line file and thinking,
“Okay… I need to break this down.”

# The Value of Reusable Components:

The first and most important mindset shift is to start thinking about components like functions: they should do one thing, do it well, and ideally, be reusable. The more reusable your components are, the more consistent and maintainable your application becomes.

# A well-designed component:

- Makes your codebase cleaner and easier to understand,
- Reduces duplication,
- Encourages scalability,
- And helps other developers (or future you) read and reuse your code with confidence.
  Not using reusable components when you should is a common mistake — one I’ve made myself.
  But it’s also one of the best ways to learn.

# Conclusion

Reusable components aren't just a "nice to have" — they are the foundation of building scalable, maintainable React applications. Don't create components just because you can. Create them because they have a clear purpose, can be used again, and help your code become more structured and future-proof. And remember — good code isn’t just about getting things to work. It’s about writing something that makes sense tomorrow, not just today.
